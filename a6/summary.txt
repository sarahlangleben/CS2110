Time spent on the assignment, in hours: 12

Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)
We worked together throughout the assignment and wrote the code together, usually one person would write the code at a time, and then we
would run it/review it together to make sure it worked.

Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)
We based our testing on the documentation and provided screenshots in the assignment handout to make sure everything was working.
We tested by running the game and attempting edge cases like saving to a read-only file, creating a new file, changing the speed/size
sliders to their min/max values, as well as attempting expected behavior like clicking on the dot, not clicking on the dot, and pressing
the start button. 

Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?) 
None that we know of.

Comments on the assignment:
This assignment was helpful for getting a better understanding of how to use Swing and incorporate it into a simple java-based game.
